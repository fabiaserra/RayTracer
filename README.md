# RayTracer

This is just another implementation of a Ray Tracer based on Peter Shirley's [book series](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/). This is written fully in C++ and I have tried to follow as much as possible modern C++ as an exercise for me to learn the new features.

At this stage the ray tracer includes pretty much everything up until the second book "Ray Tracing: The Next Week" but I will try keep adding new things and improve its performance.
